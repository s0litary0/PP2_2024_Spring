#Example 1

x = 4
y = "Sultan"
print(x, y)


#Example 2

x = 4       # x is of type int
x = "Samal" # x is now of type str
print(x)


#Example 3

x = str(3)    # x will be '3'
y = int(3)    # y will be 3
z = float(3)  # z will be 3.0


#Example 4

x = 5
y = "John"
print(type(x))
print(type(y))


#Example 5

x = "John"
# is the same as
x = 'John'


#Example 6

a = 4
A = "Sally"
